## New contributors
The ideal scenario for open source projects is a healthy mix of consistent core contributors and a steady influx of new contributors. This balance ensures both stability and fresh perspectives, maximizing the compound interest effect of collaborative innovation.

Next.js, for example, has a healthy balance of internal and external contributors, with a consistent flow of new contributors joining the project. This can also lead to a more sustainable project in the long run, as it's not dependent on a single source of contributions and has a low lottery factor.

## Engagement
As open source ecosystems grow, so does the need to understand and measure the impact of individual contributions track the value of a contributor's contributions.

Imagine a system where each contribution isn't just counted, but weighted based on its quality, impact, and the contributor's track record, allowing you to:

## Contributor Confidence

To understand evolving motivations requires regularly engaging with your contributors and creating space and flexibility for their continued contributions. Creating feedback loops and regular check-ins with your active contributors can help to gauge their continued participation in your project, but also understanding the Contributor Confidence of the project can be a good way to understand if the contributors motivations are impacting whether or not they’re contributing or if the approachability of the project is an issue.

Contributor Confidence is a metric that helps us understand the likelihood of someone who interacts with a repository (by starring or forking it) coming back to actually contribute code or other content. For example, a high Contributor Confidence score (e.g., 37-50%) suggests a welcoming and active repository where your contributions are likely to be seen and valued, while a low score (e.g., 1-3%) might indicate it’s harder for outside contributors to get involved.
